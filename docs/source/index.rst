Welcome to python-freeDictionaryAPI's documentation!
====================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   user_guide/index
   reference/index


.. note::

   `API that used in this library <https://dictionaryapi.dev/>`_
   does not provide present of all fields in response.

   So, **be aware**, when response is parsed
   and some of the fields are empty in result -
   in code they`ll be returning ``None``.


Indices and tables
